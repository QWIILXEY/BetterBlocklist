# Additions

- Your hosts file Location:
   - Linux, Unix and Mac OS X -> ``/etc/hosts``
   - Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 and 11 -> ``C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts``
   - Windows 2000 -> ``C:\WINNT\system32\drivers\etc\hosts``
   - Windows 98/ME -> ``C:\WINDOWS\hosts``
<br><b>WARNING: Do not use Host files larger than 1MB on Windows directly, Windows can't handle that and won't do any lookups anymore for some obscure reason. Rather use <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a> or <a href="https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome">AdGuardHome</a></b>

- The ente.dev Domain uses Cloudflare <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-rÃ¶outing/">Argo Smart Routing</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/">CDN</a> in combination with a strong Server for the fastest delivery possible globally, so you shouldn't experience much delay in pulling updates from these lists.

- <a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/#setting-up-pi-hole-as-a-recursive-dns-server-solution"><b>I very much recommend you to use unbound in addition to Pi-Hole for better Privacy</b></a>

A great Way of finding fake Shops is just searching the following Keywords:
 - <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Kindly+keep+in+mind+that+we+produce+on+demand.+We+do+not+stock+items">Kindly keep in mind that we produce on demand. We do not stock items</a>
